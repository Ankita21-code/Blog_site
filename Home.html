  <h2><b> Why Short films?</b></h2>
  <p class="para" style="line-height: 1.5;">
  The increasingly rare industry term “short subject” carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film. Short films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals and
  made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all. They are usually funded by film grants, nonprofit organizations, sponsor, or personal funds.<br >
   Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to
  showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors, a production company, or film studios. Short films are a typical first stage for new filmmakers, but professional actors and crews often still choose to create short
  films as an alternative form of expression. <br>
  Amateur filmmaking has grown in popularity as equipment has become more accessible. With personal ties and real-life experiences, any story can be told. Yes, short films are brief, but the information
  placed must be thought-out. Cutting out the right amount of footage and clips is crucial for the influence of the film. With every short film placed before a movie, we are basically given a mini gift.
