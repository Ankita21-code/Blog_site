              After a doctor informs Donnelly (Gleeson) that his wife died at 3 o’clock in the morning, he brings Donnelly to his wife’s bedside to say goodbye, then excusing himself as the doctor is unusually busy: there’d been two cot deaths, and a woman shot so brutally by her son ‘she had no head left on her’. Donnelly spends a few final moments awkwardly talking to his wife and gives her a photo of ‘David’, their pet rabbit.<br>

                While on a train ride home, Donnelly sits opposite a chain-smoking kid (Conroy), who reveals himself to be a manic foul-mouth. In his forlorn state, Donnelly tolerates the kid, allowing himself to be engaged in some inane conversations. Less accepting of the kid’s abrasive manners are a couple sitting across the aisle. After some animated exchanges, the kid leaves to get something from the buffet cart. At this time, Donnelly inquires, and learns that the couple just lost their son from a cot death.<br>
